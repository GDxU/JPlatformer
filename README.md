# About JPlatformer

JPlatformer is a classic platform game that comes with a built-in world editor. This game is all about collecting score, avoiding deadly creatures and reaching the finish line. The included editor enables the player to create, test and play their own worlds. JPlatformer is built on [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), it is portable and runs cross-platform thanks to Java.

# Going open source

I developed JPlatformer as a spare time project quite a while ago and had a great time putting together all kinds of work for it, like writing code, drawing sprites and recording audio samples. Being one of my first major Java projects, JPlatformer was quite a challenge and a great way to dive into the language. As the project came to an end, I published it as freeware on various platforms. Initially, I didn't even think about going open source. However, after some very positive feedback and source code requests, I decided to release JPlatformer as open source software.

This repository is all you need in order to run and modify JPlatformer. Please feel free to contribute and extend the project. There is still plenty of room for improvements and new ideas.

# Getting started

JPlatformer is a Java project and utilizes Maven. Please make sure you have the [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/index.html) or higher and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed. It's very easy to get JPlatformer up and running. Run `mvn clean compile exec:java` to launch the game and `mvn package` to build. Please refer to the [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/) for details.

# Latest release

You can download the latest release [right here](http://www.stefanhoesemann.com/projects_jplatformer.html).

The game is quick and easy to setup, as it's portable and doesn't need to be installed. Just unzip the downloaded file to whereever you want and launch `JPlatformer.jar`. Windows users may also run `JPlatformer.exe`. JPlatformer requires Java 8 or higher and runs on all supported platforms.
